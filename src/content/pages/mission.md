## Focus Areas and Key Features

The Global Building Data Initiative starts with a Phase 1 for Design and Develop Methods and Tools for the Global
Building Data Initiative”. Phase 1 is crucial to provide the methodological and technical backbone for developing the
evidence base during global rollout of data collection and analysis as well as methods for target setting in subsequent
phases. Phase 1 is designed to address crucial tasks required for preparing the ground and ensuring effectiveness and
long-term success of the initiative.

## Objectives
Phase 1 of the Global Building Data Initiative has four key objectives:
- Identify and engage key initiatives to establish a global network of relevant stakeholders.
- Design and develop an open data protocol for global building data collection.
- Design and develop the technical infrastructure for global data collection and analysis.
- Implement and validate the approach with key data partners ahead of global rollout.

## Work Packages
To ensure achievement of the key objectives, Phase 1 of the Global Building Data Initiative is implemented along five
dedicated work packages (WPs):
- WP1: Stakeholder engagement and network building with key initiatives
- WP2: Development of open data protocol for building data collection
- WP3: Development of technical infrastructure for global data collection and analysis
- WP4: Validation of data collection with key partners for global rollout (phase 2)
- WP5: Project coordination and communications
