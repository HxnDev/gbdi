  - title: "The Global Building Data Initiative Builds on a Global Expert Community"
    content: "To succeed, the Global Building Data Initiative builds on a global expert community concerned with whole life embodied carbon assessment to support industry and policy makers. The initiative will expand existing collaborations with representatives from key initiatives such as the Carbon Leadership Forum (CLF) (USA), SE2050 (USA), ECHO (USA), IStructE (UK), BECD (UK), WBCSD (Global), GABC (Global), EDGE World Bank Group (Global). Furthermore, we ensure continued high quality of our work through involvement of leading academic institutions and experts from, for example, ETHZ (CH), EPFL (CH), KU Leuven (BE), University of Strathclyde (UK), University of Washington (USA), DTU (DK)."
